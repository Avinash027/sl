-- Creating tables for Practical 1
CREATE TABLE Account (
  Acc_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
  branch_name VARCHAR(255),
  balance DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE Branch (
  branch_name VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  branch_city VARCHAR(255),
  assets DECIMAL(15, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE Customer (
  cust_name VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  cust_street VARCHAR(255),
  cust_city VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Depositor (
  cust_name VARCHAR(255),
  acc_no INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
  FOREIGN KEY (acc_no) REFERENCES Account(Acc_no)
);

CREATE TABLE Loan (
  loan_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
  branch_name VARCHAR(255),
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
  FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

-- Sample Insertions
INSERT INTO Account VALUES (1, 'Akurdi', 5000.00);
INSERT INTO Branch VALUES ('Akurdi', 'Pune', 200000.00);
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES ('John Doe', 'Main St', 'Pune');
INSERT INTO Depositor VALUES ('John Doe', 1);
INSERT INTO Loan VALUES (1001, 'Akurdi', 15000.00);
INSERT INTO Borrower VALUES ('John Doe', 1001);

-- Queries
-- Q1. Find the names of all branches in loan relation.
SELECT DISTINCT branch_name FROM Loan;

-- Q2. Find all loan numbers for loans made at Akurdi Branch with loan amount > 12000.
SELECT loan_no FROM Loan WHERE branch_name = 'Akurdi' AND amount > 12000;

-- Q3. Find all customers who have a loan from bank. Find their names, loan_no, and loan amount.
SELECT Borrower.cust_name, Borrower.loan_no, Loan.amount 
FROM Borrower 
JOIN Loan ON Borrower.loan_no = Loan.loan_no;

-- Q4. List all customers in alphabetical order who have a loan from Akurdi branch.
SELECT Customer.cust_name 
FROM Customer 
JOIN Borrower ON Customer.cust_name = Borrower.cust_name
JOIN Loan ON Borrower.loan_no = Loan.loan_no
WHERE Loan.branch_name = 'Akurdi'
ORDER BY Customer.cust_name;

-- Q5. Find all customers who have an account or loan or both at the bank.
SELECT Customer.cust_name FROM Customer 
WHERE cust_name IN (SELECT cust_name FROM Depositor)
OR cust_name IN (SELECT cust_name FROM Borrower);
